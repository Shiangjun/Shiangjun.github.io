</summary>
<p>
I am a first-year MPhil student in Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong. I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~mcyang/">Prof. Ming-Chang Yang</a> as a member of <a href="https://cuhk-mass.github.io"><u>M</u>emory <u>A</u>nd <u>S</u>torage <u>S</u>ystems Research Group (MASS)</a>. My current research interests lie on Memory Systems, Processing-In-Memory and Emerging Non-volatile Memory Systems, with a strong focus on DRAM and Racetrack Memory.
</p>
<p>
I received my Honors BSc in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/index.aspx">The University of Nottingham Ningbo China</a>, where I founded and served as the first Project Manager, in the <a href="https://unnc-ucc.github.io">User-Centric Computing Group</a>. Along with my groupmates, we creat interesting insights, build novel prototypes and examine their real-world effects.

  <td class="discussion">

	The concept of serendipity has been understood narrowly and we have previously extended it from only 
	"unexpectedness + usefulness" to "relevance + unexpectedness + usefulness". CHESTNUT, from the prototype 
	we built during 2017 to 2019, has provided the opportunity to examine the effectivenss and practicality of 
	such an approach. Compared with other development toolkits (such as Apache Mahout), CHESTNUT is fast, scalable 
	and extremely serendipitous among the largest data set publically. We announced CHESTNUT in <a href="./pdf/CHESTNUT_Invited-HCI-20.pdf">[HCI'20]</a> 
	as an invited paper and cover its real-world effects from a large-scale user study, with 104 participants from 3 countries, in <a href="./pdf/UserStudy-HCI-20.pdf">[HCI'20]</a> as well.

<div class="topic"> <h3>Rethinking Driving Simulations Infrastructure: Techniques and Extensions</h3> <table> <tbody><tr>
  <td class="discussion">

	Me and my collegues have struggled with many aspects of current cognitive driving simulations, and make several attempts to
	address and mitigate these issues. We have constructed developer-specific <a href="https://github.com/unnc-ucc/Document-OpenDS">Documentation</a> and 
	region-specific simulated suites (including both <a href="https://github.com/unnc-ucc/Scenes-OpenDS">Scenes</a> and <a href="https://github.com/unnc-ucc/Scenarios-OpenDS">Scenarios</a>)
	in the past year; We further have attempted the synthesis between simulators and real-world video streams in <a href="./pdf/Vid2vid-OpenDS-AutoUI-19.pdf">[AutomotiveUI'19]</a>;
	Based on the previous experiences, we have been bringing together the above lessons togther as Project O<sub>2</sub>. The key insight hereby is to
	provide effective supports for automated implementations. We separated them into <a href="https://github.com/unnc-ucc/Oneiros-OpenDS"> Oneiros </a> and 
	<a href="https://github.com/unnc-ucc/Omniverse-OpenDS"> Omniverse </a>, to provide flexible, aigle and easy-to-use 
	integration for scene and scenario generations. Both works are currently under revisions and pending for further submissions.

<div class="topic"> <h3>BROOK: Multi-modal and Facial Video for Human-Vehicle Interaction Research</h3> <table> <tbody><tr>
  <td class="discussion">

	Jointly supported by LandRover and Jaguar, me and my colleuges are working towards the BROOK database, as a domain-specific data support for Human-Vehicle Interactions. 
	The key insight of BROOK is to provide consistent data streams from as many angles (sensors, cameras, coordinates and etc.) as 
	possible. Every data stream could be viewed as the primary stream, and then use other streams to characterize and validate proposed designs/prototypes.
	<br><br>
	
	Our goal is to provide essential building blocks for explainable designs of personalized, automated and adaptive Human-Vehicle Interactions. 
	We have positioned BROOK in <a href="./pdf/BROOK-CHIW-20.pdf">[CHI'20 Workshop]</a> and announced our Face2Multi-modal prototype in 
	<a href="./pdf/F2M-AutoUI-20.pdf"> [Automotive'20]</a>. Our extensive characterizations and relevant designs would be announced later, and we
	would be happy to talk about them separately.
