I have been a PhD student in CSE@CUHK since 2022, advised by Prof. Ming-Chang Yang. 
I guess I am also informally advised by Prof. Yaohua Wang and Prof. Onur Mutlu (if they assume).
I would be happy to contribute to things, if they assume that these stuff can make their life easier (and, more importantly, happier).

<b>Interests.</b> I am interested in near-memory acceleration, where I (1) add incremental ideas; (2) play with simulators; 
and (3) storytell for insightful reviewers (minority). I also work on other stuff related to near-memory acceleration, based
on my personal guesses.</p>

<table class="two-col-h2"> <tbody><tr>

 </tr> </tbody></table>


<p>
<b>Games.</b> I made an incremental discovery, which showcases the feasibility to bridge (near-optimal) lossless compression
and Leibniz Binary System. The discovery was accidentally made in 2020, which made me feel like too high. 
The preprint can be found online now.<br>

<b>Collaborators.</b> I enjoy writing useless papers with my buddies, and they are 
Zilin Song, Xiaoxing Ming, Wangkai Jin, Junyu Liu, Zhuoran Bi,
Jingzhou Li, Fan Yang, Shiqi Gou, and Yuhao Dai. 
And, in this case,  I always blame my incompetence in assisting them.

<p>
<b>Reviewers.</b> People are blaming reviewers. I mean: why not just deanonymize them? 
So we can (1) acknowledge contributions from constructive reviewers (who take it as services); and 
(2) build incremental works over novel ones from RejectGPTs (who take it as privileges).

<b>Thoughts.</b> 
It's clear that some can never learn from Huixiang Chen's tragedy. I am personally curious: 
what's the exact version of the underlying hardware running those RejectGPTs, huh? 
We can only know it after a stress test, right? I admit that I find it tempting now.

<br><br>
After all, his friend did collect an involved list, huh? I would expand my interests accordingly.
If an excuse needed, here is one: rejection in the system is red. In Chinese culture,
red represents auspicious. Acceptance is green, which is bad for a headgear at least.

<p>
<b>Vice.</b> 
I assume that I would know stuff when needed: it helps me aware of my ignorance.
So if you want anything, please ask: I never keep contacts with people I don't like.

<b>Life.</b> "One say infinity the next say forever." Just different viewpoints, but why not do both?

<b>Personal.</b> 
I love pandas, and I really want to raise one.

<p>
<b>Best Joke in 2023.</b> 
A Chair Professor at my undergraduate school gets his students to have dinners with business partners,
and he is teaching courses related to ethics?
Funny.
